# STEP 3: Additional ML/AI packages
# ==============================================================================
# Run: pip install -r requirements-step3-extras.txt
#
# WHY THIS IS LAST:
# -----------------
# These packages have flexible dependencies and should be installed after the
# core TensorFlow/PyTorch stack to avoid version conflicts.
#
# NUMPY COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
# ----------------------------
# Several packages in this file have NumPy version constraints:
# - shap>=0.50.0 requires numpy>=2.0 (INCOMPATIBLE with TensorFlow 2.15.1)
# - shap<0.50.0 works with numpy<2.0 (COMPATIBLE)
#
# We pin shap>=0.42.0,<0.50.0 to ensure NumPy 1.x compatibility.
# If you see "numpy.core._multiarray_umath failed to import", check:
#   pip show numpy  # Should be 1.26.x, NOT 2.x
#

# ==========================================================================
# TRANSFORMERS / DIFFUSION STACK
# ==========================================================================
# For text/image generation, CLIP, stable diffusion, etc.
# These versions are tested to work together.
#
# IMPORTANT: Updated from older versions to support accelerate library
# (required for efficient Stable Diffusion loading).
#
# Version requirements:
# - transformers>=4.57.0: Required for compatibility with accelerate>=1.12.0
# - tokenizers>=0.22.0: Required for compatibility with transformers>=4.57.0
# - diffusers>=0.36.0: Required to use modern huggingface_hub API (older
#   versions use deprecated cached_download function removed in hub>=0.34.0)
# - accelerate>=1.12.0: Strongly recommended by diffusers for faster model
#   loading, lower memory usage, and multi-GPU support
transformers>=4.57.0
tokenizers>=0.22.0
diffusers>=0.36.0
accelerate>=1.12.0

# ==========================================================================
# HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION
# ==========================================================================
# Bayesian optimization for model tuning
# scikit-optimize is lightweight alternative to Optuna
scikit-optimize>=0.9.0

# ==========================================================================
# MODEL INTERPRETABILITY
# ==========================================================================
# SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance
#
# CRITICAL VERSION CONSTRAINT:
# - shap>=0.50.0 requires numpy>=2.0 which breaks TensorFlow 2.15.1
# - We MUST use shap<0.50.0 to maintain numpy<2.0 compatibility
# - shap 0.49.x is the last version supporting numpy 1.x
#
# If pip resolves to shap>=0.50.0, manually install:
#   pip install "shap>=0.42.0,<0.50.0"
shap>=0.42.0,<0.50.0
