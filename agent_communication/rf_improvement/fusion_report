Performance vs Metadata-only:
Kappa: -91% (0.022 vs 0.254) 🚨
Accuracy: -41% (34.14% vs 57.79%) 🚨
F1 Macro: -47% (0.231 vs 0.436) 🚨
Performance vs Thermal_map-only:
Kappa: -85% (0.022 vs 0.145) 🚨
Accuracy: -26% (34.14% vs 45.88%) 🚨
F1 Macro: -41% (0.231 vs 0.393) 🚨
Status: ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE - Fusion is worse than both individual modalities
🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
1. Multi-modal Fusion Degradation
Adding thermal_map to metadata reduces Kappa by 91% (0.254 → 0.022)
The fusion is worse than either modality alone
This is the opposite of expected behavior
2. Performance Ranking
🥇 Metadata alone: Kappa 0.254
🥈 Thermal_map alone: Kappa 0.145
❌ Metadata + Thermal_map: Kappa 0.022
3. Architecture Message Confirmed But Performance Failed
✅ Model message: "Model: Metadata + 1 image - preserving RF quality in fusion"
✅ No crashes during training
❌ But performance is catastrophically bad
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
The fusion architecture may have the following issues:
Hypothesis 1: Fusion Layer Not Learning Properly
The lightweight fusion layer may not be weighting the modalities correctly
Thermal_map may be dominating and degrading the good metadata predictions
Hypothesis 2: RF Quality NOT Actually Preserved in Fusion
While metadata-only preserves RF quality (Kappa 0.254)
The fusion path may be re-learning or degrading RF predictions
Need to inspect the fusion architecture more carefully
Hypothesis 3: Thermal_map and Metadata Incompatible
The two modalities may provide conflicting signals
Simple concatenation/fusion may amplify noise
NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATIONS
Option A: Investigate Fusion Architecture 🔍
Inspect the actual fusion model architecture for metadata + thermal_map
Check layer-by-layer what's happening to RF predictions
Verify the fusion layer is actually lightweight and not re-learning
Option B: Test Different Image Modality 🔄
Try metadata + depth_rgb instead of metadata + thermal_map
See if the problem is thermal_map specifically or fusion in general
Option C: Debug Training Process 🐛
Check training logs for metadata + thermal_map
Look for signs of overfitting, gradient issues, or optimization problems
Check if fusion weights are reasonable
Option D: Accept Metadata-Only ✅
Since metadata-only (Kappa 0.254) beats all other configurations
And TEST 4 confirms architecture is correct (no Dense layer)
Consider deploying metadata-only as the validated solution
FINAL VALIDATION STATUS
Test	Status	Result
TEST 1 (Metadata-only)	✅ PASS	Kappa 0.254 >> 0.19 target
TEST 2 (Metadata + thermal_map)	❌ FAIL	Fusion degradation
TEST 3 (thermal_map only)	✅ PASS	Works but worse than metadata
TEST 4 (Architecture)	✅ PASS	No Dense layer confirmed
TEST 5 (Comparison)	✅ PASS	+133% vs broken version
Production Recommendation:
✅ Metadata-only is PRODUCTION READY (Kappa 0.254, +133% improvement)
⚠️ Multi-modal fusion needs investigation before deployment
