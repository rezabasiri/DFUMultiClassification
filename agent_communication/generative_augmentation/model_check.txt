## Summary

**Models Status:** Not present in current repository

**Expected Structure:**
- Base: Codes/MultimodalClassification/ImageGeneration/models_5_7/
- 9 subdirectories needed (3 modalities × 3 phases):
  - rgb_I, rgb_P, rgb_R
  - thermal_map_I, thermal_map_P, thermal_map_R
  - depth_map_I, depth_map_P, depth_map_R

**Impact:**
- Cannot test generative augmentation effectiveness without models
- Code infrastructure exists but models are missing
- Models were likely trained separately and not committed to git

---

## Next Steps

1. **Locate existing models:**
   - Check if models exist on original training machine
   - Check backup/external storage
   - Models are likely large (500MB-2GB each)

2. **Alternative: Disable generative augmentation:**
   - Focus on other augmentation methods (already tested)
   - General augmentation (brightness, contrast, etc.) is working

3. **Alternative: Retrain models:**
   - Requires Stable Diffusion fine-tuning pipeline
   - Time-intensive (hours per model)
   - Needs sufficient training images per phase

**Recommendation:** Proceed with other experiments while locating models
