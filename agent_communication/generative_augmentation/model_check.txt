=== Generative Augmentation Model Availability Check ===
Date: Sat Jan 17 17:11:42 UTC 2026

Expected location: results/GenerativeAug_Models/
Status: ✓ BEING ADDED (43 GB)

Original location: Codes/MultimodalClassification/ImageGeneration/models_5_7/
New location: results/GenerativeAug_Models/

---

## Summary

**Models Status:** Being added to results/GenerativeAug_Models/

**Expected Structure:**
- Base: results/GenerativeAug_Models/
- 9 subdirectories needed (3 modalities × 3 phases):
  - rgb_I, rgb_P, rgb_R
  - thermal_map_I, thermal_map_P, thermal_map_R
  - depth_map_I, depth_map_P, depth_map_R

**Impact:**
- ✓ Models being added (43 GB total)
- ✓ Code infrastructure exists and ready to use
- Added to .gitignore to prevent GitHub upload

**Notes:**
- Models excluded from git due to large size (43 GB)
- .gitignore updated with:
  - results/GenerativeAug_Models/
  - Common large file patterns (*.pth, *.bin, *.safetensors, *.ckpt, etc.)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify model structure:**
   - Once copied, verify 9 subdirectories exist
   - Check model format (diffusers/safetensors)
   - Confirm model_index.json present in each

2. **Update code to use new path:**
   - Update base_dir in code from old path to results/GenerativeAug_Models/
   - Test model loading works correctly

3. **Begin effectiveness testing:**
   - Baseline run (gen aug OFF)
   - Full run (gen aug ON)
   - Ablation studies per modality

**Recommendation:** Verify models load correctly before starting experiments
